I used this sources to creat avery simple game based on the following fact: given 3 positive intergers (a,b,c) we define two an opertion (*) by choosing two numbers {x,y}where x<=y among {a,b,c} and replace x by 2*x and y by y-x
Fact :
whatever the choice of three positive integers we can always perform a succession of opertions of type (*) to obtain (0,*,*)

here is a screen shot of the game:
